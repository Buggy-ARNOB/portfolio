                - Uncle Ben, 'Spider-Man', 2002.</h3>
            <p align="justify">Spider-Man has spider-like abilities including superhuman strength and the ability to
                cling
                to most surfaces. He is also extremely agile and has amazing reflexes. Spider-Man also has a “spider
                sense”
                that warns him of impending danger.

                Spider-Man has supplemented his powers with technology. Being a brilliant chemist and scientist, Peter
                has
                made web-slingers, bracelets that shoot out a sticky webbing, allowing him to swing from building to
                building and ensnare opponents. He has also developed stingers that shoot powerful energy blasts that
                can
                stun foes.</p>
